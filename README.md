# Water-Quality-Datasets

The data presented are a subset of those used in Weller et al. (unpublished); Table 1 in Weller et al. (unpublished) lists all datasets used by said publication including appropraite citations. Only those datasets used by Weller et al. (unpublished) are included here if the data owners gave permission for the data to be shared, and the data were not already publicly available. The data included here do not represent the full dataset (e.g., GPS coordinates, site names, and waterway names were dropped); please reach out to the data owners for the full dataset. Some of the variables in these datasets were added by Weller et al. (unpublished) and will not be included in the full dataset provided by the data owners (e.g., methods variables). 

If you download and use a given dataset, cite the original data source(s) as well as Weller at al. (unpublished). The citation for the original data source can be found by linking the dataset name with Table 1 in Weller at al. (unpublished).
